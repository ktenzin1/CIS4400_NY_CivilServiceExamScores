#Data Modeling: First creating dimensional modeling using DbSchema (originally planned to use BigQuery as a data warehouse)
#Downloaded the SQL script for creating the data warehouse after the dimensional modeling was done. The JPG file of the schema was also downloaded.
#After transformation, the dimensional modeling was done again for Redshift data warehouse using DbSchema. Updated the SQL script and the JPG file.
